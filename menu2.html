    answers: ["Cut capsule, wipe rim, insert corkscrew", "Twist cork out quickly", "Push cork in", "Break neck of bottle"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Use knife to cut capsule below lip. Wipe rim with clean napkin. Insert corkscrew slightly off-center. Pull steadily without jerking. Final 'kiss' sound is ideal."

    question: "When should you decant wine?",
    answers: ["Young tannic reds or aged wines with sediment", "All wines", "Only white wines", "Never"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Decant young reds (Barolo, Cabernet) to soften tannins; old wines to separate sediment. Most whites and everyday reds don't need decanting."

    answers: ["Light to heavy, dry to sweet", "Whatever's ready first", "Red before white", "Sweet before dry"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Progress from light-bodied to full-bodied, dry to sweet. Whites before reds, young before old, simple before complex. Sweet wines always last."

    answers: ["5oz for still, 6oz for sparkling", "Fill glass completely", "2oz tasting pour", "No standard"],

    explanation: "5oz allows proper swirling/aeration. Sparkling gets 6oz to maintain bubbles. 25oz bottle = ~5 glasses. Adjust for oversized/bowled glasses."

    question: "How to quickly chill wine?",
    answers: ["Ice water bath (20 mins)", "Freezer (5 mins)", "Add ice cubes", "Refrigerator (hours)"],

    question: "What to do if wine is corked?",
    answers: ["Apologize and replace immediately", "Serve anyway", "Charge guest anyway", "Blame guest"],

    answers: ["Stay calm, assess validity, offer solution", "Argue with guest", "Ignore complaint", "Blame producer"],

    answers: ["Use preservation system, date bottles", "Leave open indefinitely", "Refrigerate reds", "No special handling"],

    answers: ["Be knowledgeable but not pretentious", "Show off expertise", "Speak in jargon", "Ignore guests"],

    question: "How to properly handle wine glasses?",
    answers: ["Hold by stem or base", "Grab bowl with full hand", "Touch rim", "Stack multiple glasses"],

    question: "When to use an ice bucket?",
    answers: ["Sparkling and sweet whites", "All wines", "Only red wines", "Never"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Champagne and dessert wines benefit from ice buckets. Most whites just need proper fridge temp. Never chill reds below 55Â°F - it mutes flavors."

    question: "What to do with the cork?",
    answers: ["Place on table unless guest inspects", "Give to every guest", "Throw away immediately", "Keep in pocket"],

    explanation: "Set cork near host unless they examine it. Don't make them smell it - TCA is detectable in wine. Only mention if natural cork (vs synthetic)."

    answers: ["Confirm wine's condition", "Show off pouring skill", "Give free samples", "No reason"],

    answers: ["Only if flawed, not for dislike", "Always", "Never", "Only expensive bottles"],

    answers: ["Offer to recork for takeaway", "Discard immediately", "Serve to next guest", "Staff drinks"],
